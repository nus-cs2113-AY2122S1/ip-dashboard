Instead of \"/by\" and \"/at\", \"|\" symbol is used to differentiate between the task description and date and time information.\n\nSome of the methods in Duke class are changed to private because they modify the list which is a private attribute. This improves the encapsulation.\n\nThe code is more abstract as the main function contains only the commands.
